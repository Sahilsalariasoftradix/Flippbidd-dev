        We do not initially filter, edit, publish or review any user generated
        content, comments, testimonials, reviews or analogous material prior to

        opinions. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, FlippBidd shall
        not be liable for the comments or for any liability, damages, or

      <p>
        You agree that we may moderate FlippBidd’s access to any visitor or
        user, at our sole discretion (e.g., by blocking (e.g., IP addresses),

        waives our right to moderate, or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Internet is not an anonymous means of communications, thus we cannot
        guarantee the confidentiality of any content that you provide to us via
        the services. Each piece of content that you post is intended for public
        review, and except for content expressly marked as private, most user

        being made publicly available for users in our website/app and other
        third party websites, including search engines and social media sites.
        Not all content can be marked as private.

        FlippBidd has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any user
        activity and ‘user generated content’ (e.g., names, photos, posts,
        feedback, images, comments, questions, and other content) to determine
        compliance thereof, and to edit, refuse to post, or remove any material
        or content submitted to or posted on our services that we find to be in
        violation of our terms of Use or that is otherwise objectionable.

        consider requests to remove links, but we are not obligated to do so or
        to respond to you directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        You acknowledge and agree that FlippBidd shall not be required to
        actively monitor nor exercise any editorial control whatsoever over the
        content of any message or material or information created, obtained or
        accessible through the services or site. Each visitor or user is solely
        responsible for the contents of his or her communications and may be
        held legally liable or accountable for the content of his or her
        comments or other material or information.
      </p>

      <h2>NO SPAM POLICY</h2>
      <p>

        partners, licensors, suppliers and affiliates will require your prior
        consent to such communication. Our commercial communications will
        include measures in order for you to stop receiving them, usually

        For user convenience only, we may provide third parties hyperlinks to
        other website/apps and resources on the FlippBidd. You are advised not
        to take the presence of such third party links as FlippBidd’s

        linked website/app, except we specifically state so.
      </p>
      <p>
