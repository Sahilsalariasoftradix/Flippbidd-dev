      </p>

      <h2>Platform Providers</h2>

        We host our platform infrastructure and backend services through
        third-party providers such as Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web
        Services. Your personal information may be stored, processed, and

      <h2>Technical Information Collected via the Website/App</h2>
      <p>
        As you navigate through the website/app using a desktop or mobile
        browser, certain information may be passively collected using
        technologies such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, cookies, Internet
        tags, and navigational data.
      </p>

      <h3>Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses</h3>
      <p>
        An IP Address is assigned to your computer by your Internet service
        provider and is generally considered non-personally identifiable since
        it often changes dynamically. We use IP addresses to diagnose server
        issues, report aggregate information, determine optimal connection
        paths, and improve our services.
      </p>

      <h3>Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        Cookies are small data files sent to your browser to help websites
        remember information about you. Our cookies may store data including:

        <li>Logged-in customer session</li>
        <li>Logged-in customer ID</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Our website/app uses Internet tags (e.g., single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs,
        1x1 GIFs) that are smaller than cookies. These tags inform the server
        about details such as your IP address and browser type.
      </p>

      <h3>Navigational Data</h3>
      <p>
        Also known as log files, server logs, or clickstream data, navigational
        data is used for system administration, site improvement, market
        research, and communication with site visitors.
      </p>

      <h3>Analytics</h3>
      <p>
        We use analytics tools, including Google Analytics, to measure usage
        trends and better understand our user base. These tools help us analyze
        traffic patterns and user behavior across devices. You can learn more

      <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
      <p>
        We may share anonymized or aggregated information with advertisers or
        publishers. This includes metrics such as user views, demographic
        breakdowns, conversion rates, and interaction timestamps. Certain
        features may allow users to opt in or opt out of sharing their personal
        information with advertisers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, we may share de-identified data with third parties for
        research, marketing, analytics, or other lawful purposes.
      </p>
      <h2>THE WAYS WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
      <p>We use the information collected from and about you:</p>
      <p>
        To make our services available to users;
        <br />
        To inform you about modifications to our website/app and services;
        <br />
        To enable us to appraise, and consequently improve our website/app and
        its services;
        <br />
        To customize your experience;
        <br />
        To inform you about events and/or services which may interest you, but
        only if you have agreed to be so informed;
        <br />
        To troubleshoot problems and resolve disputes; and
        <br />
        To discover and protect ourselves against error, fraud and other
        criminal activities.
        <br />
        Facilitate account creation and logon process.
        <br />
        Post testimonials.
        <br />
        To request feedback and to contact you about your use of our
        website/app, to manage a promotion, survey or other functionalities
        provided via the website/app.
        <br />
        In order to enable user-to-user and user-to-business communications.
        <br />
        Enforce our terms, conditions and policies for business purposes, to
        comply with legal and regulatory requirements or in connection with our
        contract.
        <br />
        Respond to legal requests and prevent harm. If we receive a subpoena or
        other legal request, we may need to inspect the data we hold to
        determine how to respond.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our services implement a chat function among users, which is a material
        part of our offerings. Our chat allows users to "Add Participants" to
        the chat rooms to have multiple people on the chat all at once. However
        users can not invite other people to the chat if they do not have their
        phones numbers stored.
      </p>
      <p>
        In such way, FlippBidd will only allow users to add participants and
        show the list of contacts once the user authorizes the app to sync their
        contacts using his/her phone’s authorization screen to allow FlippBidd
        to have access to the contact list.
      </p>
      <p>
        We and/or our third-party marketing partners may use the personal
        information you send to us for our marketing purposes, if this is in
        accordance with your marketing preferences. For example, when expressing
        an interest in obtaining information about us or our website/app,
        subscribing to marketing or otherwise contacting us, we will collect
        personal information from you. You can opt-out of our marketing emails
        at any time
      </p>
      <p>
        We may use your information to develop and display personalized content
        and advertising (and work with third parties who do so) tailored to your
        interests and/or location and to measure its effectiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
        FlippBidd will keep any collected information only as long as it is
        legally necessary, with regard to the purpose of its processing. Upon
        the case of information which is stored by our sub-processors, the data
        will be stored on their secure servers as indicated on their respective
        privacy policies from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not wish to disclose any or part of your information to us,
        you may still be able to use some of the functionalities of our
        website/app, though we will not be able to guarantee that you will be
        able to enjoy them at their fullest if you elect not to disclose it to
        us.

        information about users who view their ads.

        following circumstances arise:
        <br />
        (i) if necessary under an applicable law; <br />
        (ii) in reply to a legal demand or subpoena from an agency of the law;{" "}
        <br />
        (iii) to protect ourselves and our affiliates from any legal third party
        claims and procedures that may be brought to us (inclusive of takedown
        notices); and/or <br />
        (iv) to prevent or cause cessation of any undertakings that may be
        construed by us as having the ability to be or cause a predicament or
        hazard to us.
      </p>

      <h2>ADVERTISING, OPT-OUT CHOICE</h2>
      <p>
        We, along with third-party vendors such as Google, use first-party
        cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies
        (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers in
        order to collect information and marketing analytics about the manner in
        which you browse our website/app.
      </p>
      <p>
        From time to time, we may use Google Analytics, Ad Words, Double Click
        and/or Ad Sense tracking codes, and other third-party software tools
        (such as remarketing codes) in order to collect information and
        marketing analytics about the manner in which you browse our platform
        and services.
      </p>
      <p>
        The served ads will be targeted based on your previous browsing history,
        and may include retargeting codes. For example, third-party vendors may
        show you FlippBidd’s ads on certain websites across the Internet, even
        after you leave our platform. The collected information is anonymized,
        meaning it cannot be tracked back to individuals. Using such tools, we
        learn how to optimize, and serve ads based on a user’s past visits,
        providing you with a better user experience.
      </p>

      <h2>DO-NOT-TRACK DISCLOSURE</h2>
      <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can
        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
        online browsing activities monitored and collected.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
        implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
        currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
        automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
        standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
        future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
        this privacy notice.
      </p>

      <h2>COMMERCIAL MESSAGE NEWSLETTERS</h2>
      <p>
        Occasionally, we will ask you for express permission and approval to
        receive electronic messages in electronic format which are then sent to
        an electronic address and that contains a message asking recipients to
        participate in commercial activities such as newsletters, purchase of
        products, services and invitations to participate in surveys.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will send you service-related announcements on occasions when it is
        necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily
        suspended for maintenance, or a new enhancement is released, which will
        affect the way you use our services, we might send you an email.
        Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are
        neither commercial nor promotional in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, you have the right to object to the processing of your
        personal data if grounds for this objection is to direct marketing.
        Henceforth, if you no longer wish to receive email update and other
        commercial communications and messages, you may opt-out of receiving
        them by following the instructions included in each update or
        communication.
      </p>

      <h2>CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</h2>
      <p>
        You must at least be eighteen (18) years of age or older to use our
        services. For purposes of clarification, we do not legally accept users
        under such age into our services.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to request any and all applicable proof of
        identification and consent proof from our users, at any moment, without
        prior notice, and at our sole and final discretion. Upon the failure to
        provide such proof of age, we reserve the right to immediately freeze,
        block or cancel the account, with no liability.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will never intentionally collect private information from children
        under 18, except as allowed by law or with parental consent.
      </p>

      <h2>SECURITY OF INFORMATION</h2>
      <p>
        At FlippBidd, we do our best to safeguard your personal information. To
        prevent illegal access, ensure proper use of information, and maintain
        data accuracy, we deploy practical administrative practices and measures
        that safeguard your information, including transmitting it using modern
        cryptography (for example, over HTTPS).
      </p>
      <p>
        You however agree that there is no full guarantee of data security for
        information made available on or through the internet. We will thus not
        bear responsibility to unauthorized access to your information that is
        beyond our control.
      </p>
      <p>
        The security of your information is important to us, but please remember
        that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
        electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
        acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its
        absolute security.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can be assured that personal information collected through the
        website/app is secure and is maintained in a manner consistent with
        current industry standards. Although no method of transmission over the
        Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, we follow all
        requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry
        standards.
